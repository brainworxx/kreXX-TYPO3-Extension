Installation

1.) Upload the whole kreXX directory to your webserver. Put it somewhere,
    where you are able to include it to your project.
2.) Include as early as possible the file kreXX.php into your project.
    Normally this is the index.php.

If you don't want to edit files in your system, you can as well use one of our
installation modules (as soon as they are available). Basically they do the
same thing, but since they use framework functionality, kreXX is not available
before the module loads.
