Setting up a local opening function
===================================

| Imagine the following situation:
| There are several developers, designers and product owners working on your project, but you do not want them to trigger your kreXX output.
| To achieve this, you can simply setup your own developer handle.

	Setting up a Developer Handle to use as a local opening function


Like all local configurations, this is stored in a cookie inside your browser. To make use of this setting, just use the following:

.. code-block:: php

	\krexx::gue($myObject);
	// or as an alias
	krexx($myObject, 'gue');

Only people with the string “gue” added to their local configuration will now be able to trigger an analysis. kreXX will be disabled for everyone else.

Debugging a live server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Using a local open function might tempt you to debug a productive server, since only browsers with this string in their cookie can trigger kreXX.

| When it comes to debugging a live server, there is only one rule:
| Never ever debug a live server. This will only lead to trouble.
