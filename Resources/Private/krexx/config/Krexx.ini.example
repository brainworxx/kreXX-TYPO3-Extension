; kreXX CONFIGURATION FILE
;
; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[runtime]

; Is kreXX actually active?
; Here you can disable kreXX on a global level without uninstalling it.
disabled = "false"
; disabled = "true"

; Comma separated list of ip's taht can access kreXX. Wildcards are supported.
; You can do something like '192.168.1.*', but not something like '192.168.*.110'.
; iprange = "192.168.0.110,192.168.1.*"
iprange = "*"

; Shall kreXX try to detect an AJAX request?
; If set to true, there will be no output when AJAX is detected, to prevent a
; js error.
detectAjax = "true"
; detectAjax = "false"

; How deep shall we analyse objects?
; When we reach a certain level, we simply stop there and won't go any further.
level = "5"

; How often can you call kreXX in one run?
; kreXX can generate a lot of data, and depending on your settings
; increasing this number might not be a good idea.
maxCall = "10"

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[output]

; Change the above value to set the CSS skin used to render kreXX layout.
; skin = "hans"
skin = "smokygrey"

; Where shall kreXX put it's data?
; Is the output the frontend or the logfolder?
; destination = "file"
destination = "frontend"

; how many logfiles will kreXX keep?
; Files will only get deleted, when he creates a new one.
maxfiles = "10"

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[properties]
; kreXX can poll a lot of info. Depending on your needs, these might be a little
; too much. It also increases the output, which might not be a good idea

; Shall kreXX create a reflection and poll it for data?
; There might be a setter/getter for it somewhere . . .
; analyseProtected = "true"
analyseProtected = "false"
; analysePrivate = "true"
analysePrivate = "false"

; Shall kreXX analyse the constants of a class?
analyseConstants = "true"
; analyseConstants = "true"

; Shall kreXX try to traverse through the object?
analyseTraversable = "true"
; analyseTraversable = "false"

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[methods]

; Here you can configure, what analysis will be done on class methods.
; analyseProtectedMethods = "true"
analyseProtectedMethods = "false"
; analysePrivateMethods = "true"
analysePrivateMethods = "false"

; What kind of additional methods shall be called from the object?
; Comma separated list of functions. They are only called, when they are
; callable. These functions are called without parameters. They also might
; actually do stuff which might be unwanted.
debugMethods = "debug,toArray,__toString,toString"

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[backtraceAndError]

; kreXX comes with an unregistrable fatal error handler, which can be configured
; here. When set to "true", kreXX will register the handler as soon as it's
; included. When a fatal error occurs, kreXX will offer a backtrace and a
; analysis of the all objects in it. PHP always clears the stack in case of a
; fatal error, so kreXX has to keep track of it. Be warned: This option will
; dramatically slow down your requests. Use this only when you have to. It is by
; far better to register the errorhandler yourself with \krexx::registerFatal();
; and later unregister it with \krexx::unregisterFatal(); to prevent a slowdown.
; registerAutomatically = "true"
registerAutomatically = "false"

; ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[feEditing]
; Here you can edit the frontend configuration form
; full    = can be edited
; display = is displayed only
; none    = is not displayed at all
; Since the local configuration is stored in a cookie, settings will be
; ignored, in case a setting can not be edited.
; Please note, that the logging and debug methods options can never be edited
; on the frontend.
