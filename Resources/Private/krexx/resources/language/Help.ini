analyseGetterHelp = "Shall kreXX try to determine the output of getter methods?<br/> These methods will not be called. kreXX will try to get the (possible) result from the class properties, which may lead to false results."
debugMethodsHelp = "Comma-separated list of used debug callback functions. A lot of frameworks offer these, toArray and toString being the most common.<br/> kreXX will try to call them, if they are available and display their provided data.<br/> You can not change them on the frontend.

levelHelp = "Some frameworks have objects inside of objects inside of objects, and so on.<br/> Normally kreXX does not run in circles, but going too deep inside of an object tree can result in a lot of output."
