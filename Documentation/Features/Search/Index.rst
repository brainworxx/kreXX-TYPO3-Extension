Search function
===============

| Getting a lot of output is only nice, as long as you know where to find stuff.
| Imagine the following scenario: You are searching for a specific value, function or property somewhere deep inside a specific debug output "window".

kreXX offers a somewhat advanced search function:

- Marking all appearances
- Open the collapsed nodes to the output
- Scrolls down to each finding
- Each output "window" can be searched individually.
