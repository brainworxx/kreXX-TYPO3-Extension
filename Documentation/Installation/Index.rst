Installation
============

Installation is very straight forward. You can:

- Install it normally with the extension manager
- Require it with the composer :literal:`composer require typo3-ter/includekrexx`
- Require the kreXX library itself with composer :literal:`composer require brainworxx/krexx` and then install the backend extension with the extension manager to get kreXX as early inside your system as possible

There is no typoscript or pageTSconfig at all.
