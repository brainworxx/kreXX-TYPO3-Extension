Installation and bugreports
===========================

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installation is very straight forward. You can:

- Install it normally with the extension manager
- Require it with the composer :literal:`composer require typo3-ter/includekrexx`
- Require the kreXX library itself with composer :literal:`composer require brainworxx/krexx` and then install the backend extension with the extension manager to get kreXX as early inside your system as possible

There is no typoscript or pageTSconfig at all.

Bugreports
^^^^^^^^^^

As can be see in :ref:`changelog`, kreXX has been under heavy development. It is by no means bugfree, and like most software will never be.
If you encounter a bug or other unwanted behavior/feature, please let us know about it. There is a good chance that other
developers will also encounter it as well. If we don't know about it, there is a good chance that it will not get fixed.
