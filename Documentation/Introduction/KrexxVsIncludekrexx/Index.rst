=====================
kreXX vs includekrexx
=====================

There are two debuggers that you may call :literal:`kreXX`:

- :literal:`kreXX`
- :literal:`includekrexx`

And both are being developed by BRAINWORXX GmbH.

kreXX is a pure PHP debugger.

Includekrexx is extending kreXX with a lot of features that are especially useful for TYPO3 and Fluid developers and
integrators.

    kreXX and includekrexx version numbers

As shown in the image above, the version numbers of kreXX and includekrexx are not the same. This is because includekrexx
and kreXX are two different products. Includekrexx is based on kreXX, and both versions can differ.

If you want to make full use of :literal:`kreXX`, we recommend using the TYPO3 extension :literal:`includekrexx`.
