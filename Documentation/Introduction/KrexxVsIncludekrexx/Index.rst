kreXX vs includekrexx
=====================

There are two debuggers that you may call :literal:`kreXX`:

- :literal:`kreXX`
- :literal:`includekrexx`

And both are being developed by BRAINWORXX GmbH.

kreXX is a pure PHP debugger.

Includekrexx is extending kreXX with a lot of features that are especially useful for TYPO3 and Fluid developers and
integrators.
