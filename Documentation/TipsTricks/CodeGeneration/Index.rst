Code generation
===============

Displaying the values you want to know about is one thing. Reaching them is something else entirely.

We have included an automatic code generation, which generates code snippets to reach these values. There is a limitation,
though. Most values you will come across are protected, and there is most likely a reason for this.

A click on the <fluid> or <php> symbol will generate the snippet.
